Bad Day Fixer is intended to be a humorous interactive website to bring a smile to someones face who is experience a bad day. 

The website has a beginning and an end and the user path leads them in one direction. With a number of yes and no questions, there is different paths based on the answers the user gives. 

The newly created live site can be viewed  [\[here\]]([https://lisa1q84.github.io/bad-day-fixer/](https://lisa1q84.github.io/bad-day-fixer/)/). This site was designed as a project to be submitted for grading in the second milestone project in Full Stack Software Development with the Code Institute.

5.  The site owner would like the site to be accessible from all devices. 
----------

**STRATEGY**

----------

The main focus of this project is to provide a simple, interactive website that flows in one direction that has the user engaged from start to end. 

To achieve that, different types of forms, questions and gifs were included as well as a random funny fortune quote generator. 

----------

**SCOPE**

----------

Features:

-   Navigation menu – a basic and easily visible navigation menu offering the user the ability to go back to the beginning .

The sections will be:
    
-   Home/ Question 1 - The Bad Day Fixer starts with the main question "Are you having a bad day?" If the user clicks "No" another tab opens to "The Irish Sun" a boulevard newspaper with the most sensationalist headlines. When the user goes back to our website tab, he will be asked "And now?"
    
-   The answer "Yes" will lead to Question 2, asking whether the user wants their day to be fixed. When they answer "Yes", they will go to Question 3. If they answer "No" they will see "Space Facts".

-   Space Facts - Meant to be an informative site with facts about space that are meant to educate and fascinate the user. Big facts about the space tend to put peoples worries into perspective. There is a "next" button to lead the user to the "Fortune Cookie Generator".
    
-  Question 3 - A form asking the user to input what upset them. When they leave the field empty, an alert appears to input something. When they click "submit", the user gets to the next section, Question 4. 

- Question 4 - thanks the user for sharing their worries and asks whether the user would be interested to get suggestions for self-care activities. If they say "No" they are sent to "Space Facts" (see above). If they say yes, they get to see the Self Care Carousel Section

- The Self Care Carousel - includes 4 suggestions on how a user can improve their day. After clicking through the slides, the next button appears, leading the user to the "Gratitude List" section.

- Gratitude List - This section displays the worries the user inputed before and asks them to enter 5 things they are grateful for into a dynamically generated list. They can delete and re-add items but after they input 5, a "next" button will appear to show them the last section, the "Fortune Cookie Generator"

-"Fortune Cookie Generator": This section allows the user to click a button and get a random humorous fortune-cookie style quote displayed. The user can click repeatedly to see different quotes. 

----------

**STRUCTURE** 

----------

The site must be simple and clear and therefore I decided to keep it mostly black and white and to add a couple of gifs and drawings. 

There is no previous buttons because the user is meant to only move in one direction. If the user is curious what happens if they answers questions differently, they can press start and go back to the beginning. 


----------

**LOOK**

----------

The website to cheer up users experiencing a bad day has to be simple and a little artistic with images. 

Colours:

-   Black and White, in order to keep the focus on the interactive part

Typography:

-   Lato is used on the menu and the headings to give the page a unique, playful and modern look.

-   Source Sans Pro is the font for the paragraphs. It is light and modern.

I found the two of them to pair nicely together when trying them together on google-fonts.

Effects:

There is a hover effect over the menu items in the navigation bar as well as some of the buttons when they are clicked. When items are deleted from the gratitude list, there is a dropdown-effect.

Imagery:

-  For the main site, I chose a black and white illustration of a woman lying on the couch looking defeated to illustrate a bad day I found on 'Pinterest'. (Credits on the bottom section of the README).
- I chose two gifs I retrieved from the website 'Giphy' to illustrate letting go of worries and relief.

All testing was documented in a separate filed that can be accessed [here.](https://github.com/lisa1Q84/bad-day-fixer/blob/master/README.md/master/TESTING.md)

## [](https://github.com/lisa1Q84/bad-day-fixer/blob/master/README.md#bugs)Bugs

Bug: Scrollbar on the bottom when in the mobile view. Fixed this by moving the image width and height to CSS and by making them smaller. 

Bug: Carousel images look stretched in mobile view. I did not find out how to fix this because every attempt to fix it ended in me disabling the carousel. I kept it because the important part in the carousel are the reviews. 

Bug: I tried to activate the menu (so that the menu item that the user is on is highlighted) but was not able to so now the menu does change colour only when hovering on the items.

Bug: On creating a parallax effect for the background when scrolling rather than keeping the background fixed there is a white band being pulled up when scrolling to bottom.  
Fix: Changed position on the ‘sales-pitch’ element from ‘absolute’ to ‘relative’.
